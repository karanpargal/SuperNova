## üí° Goals

This project enables seamless cross-chain lending and borrowing, allowing users to lend assets on one chain and borrow on others with up to 80% liquidity. It features dynamic APY optimization based on pool liquidity and an interactive APY estimator for smarter financial decisions.

## üß† Knowledge Primer
- **Agoric** - The Agoric crypto economy is the smart contract platform that can quickly bring millions of developers to the DeFi frontier. Agoric's Hardened JavaScript makes blockchain programming safe and accessible to the 10+ million JavaScript developers.
- **Agoric Orchestration** - Agoric‚Äôs Orchestration capability allows developers to easily build cross-chain interactions into existing applications or to create novel cross-chain-focused products.
- **Keplr Wallet** - Keplr is a free, open-source, non-custodial wallet that allows users to interact with blockchain applications in the Cosmos ecosystem. It's available as a browser extension, mobile app, and webapp.

## üö© What Problems SuperNova Solves
- **Cross-Chain Lending and Borrowing** - Facilitates seamless asset utilization across multiple chains, enabling users to lend on one chain and borrow on others.
- **Liquidity Optimization** - Provides up to 80% liquidity access, ensuring efficient use of user assets.
- **Dynamic APY Management** - It adjusts interest rates based on pool liquidity, offering users the best possible returns.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making** - Features an interactive APY estimator, helping users visualize trends and make smarter financial choices.

## üëî Emphasis on Tracks

### Lit Protocol

- **Usage**:
  - **Agoric Orchestration API:** We utilised Agoric's Orchestration API to create our smart contract which handles lending, borrowing across multiple chains.
  - **Agoric React components:** We utilised Agoric's React UI component library as well to use hooks and few components to make our application more lively.
